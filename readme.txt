What Is This?

This mod adds a non-lethal concussion grenade to the game.

It's basically just a simple re-textured flashbang that deals 100% shock damage and knocks players unconscious. The grenade also shares all the same characteristics of the flashbang including sound & flash effects and it can be attached to tripwires.

Just another option for those survivors out there who prefer to take their opponents alive...

Installation:

Install it the same as any other mod - subscribe to it, copy the @ZenConcussionGrenade folder into your server folder, copy the ".bikey" file out of the mod keys folder into your server's keys folder, and don't forget to add the types.xml entry into your server's types.xml entries and tweak the spawns to your preference. The mod is required on both server and client.

Repacking & Source Code:
You can repack this mod if you want to, although keep in mind any bug fixes I make won't automatically apply to your repacked version (although this is a very simple mod and shouldn't have any bugs anyway). As with all my mods, the source code is on my GitHub and you can use it however you like. Enjoy :)
